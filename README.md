# handmade-hero

This repository contains notes and code written by me as I follow along to 
[Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network) 
by Casey Muratori.
  
I chose to write my implementation of the code in C, and for the time being use 
[raylib](https://raylib.com) 
as it is a simple library to handle the cross platform code that can be factored out later if needed.
As a result, at this stage, I have not needed to interact directly with Windows OS, XInput or DirectSound.
