# handmade-hero

This repository contains code written by me in the C programming language using the
[raylib](https://raylib.com) 
library following along to
[Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network) 
by Casey Muratori.
  
Special thanks to the
[Handmade Penguin](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin/) 
blog for tips rewriting the first 19 videos using SDL.
